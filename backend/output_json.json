It felt like we had > failed at life with no hope of ever escaping the debt. > > I enviously watched as my friends found success after success in their > careers while we struggled to get groceries on the table. I had just > been laid off and had no idea what to do with my life: I'd already > tried being a public defender for the Legal Aid Society in New York > City, being a lawyer in a large firm in Boston, working for a few > start-ups, doing business development at an advertising agency, > becoming a life coach, hosting a call-in radio show, and even opening > a small paint-your-own-pottery-studio. I felt completely lost, like > nothing I did would ever be enough to dig us out of the hole we were > in. > > To deal with the anxiety and self-doubt, my main strategy became > avoidance. Avoid getting up by hitting the snooze button. Avoid the > pain with alcohol. Avoid responsibility by blaming my husband. Avoid > looking for a job by procrastinating however I could. > > If you've ever been in this situation, you understand how monumental > even the simplest tasks seem: getting out of bed, opening your bills, > being fully present with your family, cooking a nice meal, applying > for a job, going for a walk, canceling that subscription, or even just > being honest about the extent to which you're struggling. . . > Everything feels impossible. Every morning when I woke up, the anxiety > was coursing through my veins, and I thought, *Is this really what > it's going to look like for the rest of my life*? > > But you want to know the funny thing about being stuck? I knew exactly > what I needed to do: get up, tackle the dreaded pile of bills, get the > kids > > ready for school, make myself go on walks, reach out to my friends for > support, make a budget, find a job. And yet, I couldn't seem to do any > of it. **How I Changed My Life** > I'll never forget the morning when everything changed for me. The > alarm went off, and there I was, lying in bed, completely overwhelmed > by our problems. Like so many of us, I was paralyzed by my own > thoughts, and the last thing I wanted to do was get up and face > another day. > > But then, something strange happened. A thought popped into my head > that would ultimately change my life. It was so simple, almost silly. > I remembered watching a rocket launch and the way NASA counted down to > blast off: *5-4-3-2-1*. I thought, *What if I just counted backward > like that and launched myself out of bed?* > > It seemed ridiculous, but I was desperate, so I gave it a shot. I > counted backward: *5-4-3-2-1*---and I got out of bed. Just like that. > I didn't think about how tired I was or how much I didn't want to face > my problems. I simply moved before my brain had the chance to talk me > out of it. It's like launching a rocket: Once you start the countdown, > *5-4-3-2-1*, there's no turning back. > > At that point in my life, I was so used to letting my thoughts > paralyze me and fear and stress consume me that the concept felt > completely foreign. I remember what a revelation it was when I thought > to myself, *Wait a minute, I can feel horrible and still do what I > need to do? Yes, Mel, you can.* And it worked. > > In those five seconds, I had interrupted the cycle of overthinking. It > felt like a small victory, but it was also a revelation. If I could > push through those five seconds of fear, maybe I could push through > anything. > > So, I started using this countdown everywhere in my life. > > *5-4-3-2-1* Get up when the alarm rings. > > *5-4-3-2-1* Pick up the phone and start networking to find a job. > > *5-4-3-2-1* Open the bills that had been piling up on the counter for > months. > > I started calling this the \"5 Second Rule.\" One 5-second move at a > time, I forced myself to put one foot in front of the other and slowly > step back into > > my life. I won't lie to you. It wasn't easy. The next couple of years > were among the hardest of my life. > > It's not easy to claw your way out of debt or face the painful issues > in your marriage. It's not easy to quiet the anxiety or push through > the self-doubt. It's hard to update your résumé and look for a job > when you question the value you bring. It's a grind to force yourself > to get back in shape and create healthier habits after you've let > yourself go. > > And it's definitely not glamorous to work all day, then come home, > take care of three kids, spend a few minutes with my husband, and then > stay up late every night, trying to figure out ways I can make more > money. > > But that's what I did. > > The 5 Second Rule taught me that action is the answer. Thinking about > your problems will never solve them. Waiting around to feel like doing > something means you'll never do it. It taught me that no one is coming > to save you. You must save yourself from yourself. You have to force > yourself to make little moves forward, all day, every day, especially > when you don't feel like it. > > Using *5-4-3-2-1*, I pushed through the excuses, the anxiety, the > overwhelm, and the fear. And step by step, day by day, week by week, I > slowly took the actions that put my life and career back on track. My > husband started using it to push himself to face the issues in his > business head-on, and it worked for him too. But it would be another > three years before I told anyone else about the 5 Second Rule. I had > been reluctant to share it with anyone because, first, I didn't know > why it worked. And second, I didn't feel like I was in a position to > give anybody advice. > > But that all changed one fateful day when an old roommate recommended > me as the \"perfect person\" to give advice on career change at a small > event. I suppose she thought of me because I had changed my career so > many times, even I had lost count. The event offered to fly me and my > husband to San Francisco and put us up in a hotel. When you're > struggling financially, that sounds like a free vacation, so I said > yes. This was the first time I had ever given a speech on a stage at > an event. The only public-speaking class I had ever taken was in high > school, and as soon as I boarded the plane, that's when the panic > started to sink in: *What on earth have I gotten myself into?* > > When I walked on stage and saw 700 people in the audience staring back > at me, my mind went blank, and I could feel my chest and neck turning > red. > > I then proceeded to have a 21-minute-long anxiety attack onstage. > About 19 minutes in, I forgot how to end my talk on career change, so > I blurted out the 5 Second Rule and how I use it, because I couldn't > think of anything else to say. I must have blacked out, because I also > don't remember the part where I gave everyone in the audience my email > address. And as I walked off that stage, I thought that was the worst > experience of my life. Thank God it's over. > > It turns out that small event was one of the first TEDx conferences > ever held. They filmed it, and a year later, posted the video online. > Not only did it go viral---it's become one of the most watched TEDx > talks of all time. The 5 Second Rule and its *5-4-3-2-1* countdown > spread by word of mouth around the world. As it spread, people started > to write to me at that email address, sharing stories about how the > Rule was changing their lives. I was so moved by people's stories that > I would sit up late at night, after I had put our three kids to bed, > answering their emails one by one. > > When I had been drowning in my problems, I felt like I was the only > one who had trouble doing the things I needed to do. It's not true. We > all struggle with motivation. It's a universal problem, and the 5 > Second Rule seems to be a solution that not only works for me but also > works for people all over the world. > > The stories were amazing: People had used *5-4-3-2-1* to push through > fear, procrastination, and excuses to change jobs; lose 100 pounds; > get sober; launch and sell businesses; improve their health and > marriages. The medical and clinical uses blew me away. Doctors and > psychologists were using it to treat PTSD, OCD, and depression. Even > as I'm writing this Introduction, we have heard from over a thousand > people who have used the 5 Second Rule to stop themselves from > attempting suicide and to ask for help. > > As that TEDx talk became more and more popular online, I started > getting invited to speak at other small events. I remember being asked > to talk to a group of Realtors at a bar. It was embarrassing standing > there with a beer in my hand, trying to talk over the music and people > gabbing in the next room. But I survived. I spoke in church basements, > a high school classroom, then a friend's brown-bag lunch at work, and > it just grew from there. > > I would break out in hives as I held the microphone, and I wasn't > getting paid. But the more I talked about the Rule and saw how > powerful it was for > > everyone who tried it, the more I became obsessed with understanding > why such a simple hack could lead to such profound results. > > So, I put my lawyer hat on and started researching habits, human > behavior, and the science of motivation. I needed to make a case: Why > does counting *5-4-3-2-1* work? I gathered evidence from the > experiences of ordinary people who had been using it. I found > compelling precedent from the accounts of therapists, addiction > specialists, and medical doctors who had begun recommending it to > their patients, and all the evidence pointed to a simple explanation: > > **Small, Consistent Action Changes Everything** > > Meanwhile, my friends and extended family had no idea what I was doing > because I was too scared to tell them. Mel? Giving advice? Give me a > break. She nearly destroyed her own life. > > At this point in my story, my husband had left the restaurant business > and was struggling with depression. We were still drowning in debt, so > I was working a full-time job trying to keep our family of five afloat > while dedicating nights and weekends to speaking at small events and > basically writing a dissertation on the science of motivation on the > side. > > I knew I wanted to teach the 5 Second Rule full-time and somehow make > this my career, but I didn't know how. Looking back, I can see how > paralyzed I was with imposter syndrome. What right did I have to call > myself an expert in anything? I suppose I was just waiting for some > kind of permission to put myself out there. > > Maybe you're doing that right now. Waiting for the right time. Waiting > to feel ready or a little less afraid. Waiting for someone to come > along and tell you that today is the day to start. The problem with > waiting is no one is coming. The only permission you need is your own. > > Deciding to get serious about trying to make money as a motivational > speaker was one of the best decisions I have made in my life. I'll > share more with you about what led to this breakthrough in the pages > of this book."

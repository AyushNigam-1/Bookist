    "Title": "Meditations",
    "Author": "Marcus Aurelius",
    "Description": "Meditations is a timeless series of personal writings by Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius, offering deep insights into Stoic philosophy. Through short reflections, he explores themes like resilience, discipline, humility, and the fleeting nature of life. Written as private notes to himself, the work encourages self-awareness, inner strength, and acceptance of things beyond one's control. Despite its ancient origins, Meditations remains deeply relevant for anyone seeking wisdom, peace, and clarity in their personal and professional life",
